# Changelog

All notable changes to Clousight Bench are recorded here.

## 0.2.0 — Unreleased

Developer-preview reset before the first public release.

### Changed

- Restored installable reference workloads and wheel smoke coverage.
- Made adapter implementation status explicit.
- Standardized user-facing CLI configuration errors.
- A relative reference-workload name (e.g. `workload: wordcount-py`) now
  resolves against the packaged `clousight_bench.resources.workloads` tree via
  `core.resources.reference_workload_path()`, not a repository-relative path.
  If you point a task at your own workload, pass an **absolute path** —
  relative paths that used to reach `workloads/<name>/` in a checkout no
  longer do.
- Unknown domain/task/platform lookups and a rejected skeleton adapter now
  raise typed `UnknownDomainError` / `UnknownTaskError` / `UnknownPlatformError`
  / `AdapterNotRunnableError` (all `UserInputError` subclasses) instead of a
  bare `KeyError`, so callers of the Python API get a stable, catchable
  exception hierarchy — the same one the CLI maps to exit code 2.
- The repository is public and Apache-2.0 licensed; `main` is protected by a
  ruleset requiring a pull request and the full CI matrix, with force push and
  branch deletion blocked for everyone. Security reports go through GitHub
  Security Advisories, not public issues.

### Fixed

- `csbench doctor --domain --platform` no longer hard-rejects a skeleton
  adapter before showing anything: it prints a clear "skeleton, not
  implemented" warning and still runs `adapter.preflight(task)`, so the
  credential/SDK/minimal-permission requirements a contributor needs before
  wiring the adapter are visible. `csbench run`'s hard skeleton gate (exit
  code 2, checked in the orchestrator before preflight) is unchanged.
- `--config` pointed at a directory, an unreadable file, or a non-UTF-8 file
  now fails with the same stable `UserInputError` / exit-code-2 usage error as
  a missing file or invalid YAML, instead of an unhandled
  `IsADirectoryError` / `PermissionError` / `UnicodeDecodeError` traceback.
- The `examples/README.md` J1.1 walkthrough no longer references
  `configs/bigdata-emr.local.yaml`, which was never created; the command runs
  with the packaged default workload and no `--config`.

### Compatibility

- Package version is pre-1.0.
- Result schema and plugin API are migrated in later Phase 1 plans.
