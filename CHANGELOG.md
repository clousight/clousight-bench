# Changelog

All notable changes to Clousight Bench are recorded here.

## 0.2.0 — Unreleased

Developer-preview reset before the first public release.

### Changed

- Restored installable reference workloads and wheel smoke coverage.
- Made adapter implementation status explicit.
- Standardized user-facing CLI configuration errors.
- A relative reference-workload name (e.g. `workload: wordcount-py`) now
  resolves against the packaged `clousight_bench.resources.workloads` tree via
  `core.resources.reference_workload_path()`, not a repository-relative path.
  If you point a task at your own workload, pass an **absolute path** —
  relative paths that used to reach `workloads/<name>/` in a checkout no
  longer do.
- Unknown domain/task/platform lookups and a rejected skeleton adapter now
  raise typed `UnknownDomainError` / `UnknownTaskError` / `UnknownPlatformError`
  / `AdapterNotRunnableError` (all `UserInputError` subclasses) instead of a
  bare `KeyError`, so callers of the Python API get a stable, catchable
  exception hierarchy — the same one the CLI maps to exit code 2.
- The repository is public and Apache-2.0 licensed; `main` is protected by a
  ruleset requiring a pull request and the full CI matrix, with force push and
  branch deletion blocked for everyone. Security reports go through GitHub
  Security Advisories, not public issues.

### Fixed

- `csbench doctor --domain --platform` no longer hard-rejects a skeleton
  adapter before showing anything: it prints a clear "skeleton, not
  implemented" warning and still runs `adapter.preflight(task)`, so the
  credential/SDK/minimal-permission requirements a contributor needs before
  wiring the adapter are visible. `csbench run`'s hard skeleton gate (exit
  code 2, checked in the orchestrator before preflight) is unchanged.
- `--config` pointed at a directory, an unreadable file, or a non-UTF-8 file
  now fails with the same stable `UserInputError` / exit-code-2 usage error as
  a missing file or invalid YAML, instead of an unhandled
  `IsADirectoryError` / `PermissionError` / `UnicodeDecodeError` traceback.
- The `examples/README.md` J1.1 walkthrough no longer references
  `configs/bigdata-emr.local.yaml`, which was never created; the command runs
  with the packaged default workload and no `--config`.

### Added

- Schema `0.2` result contract with `identity`, `environment`, `fingerprints`,
  `measurements`, `findings`, `observations`, `errors` and a four-value
  `status`.
- Deterministic `benchmark`, `environment` and `implementation` fingerprints
  plus a `record_digest`, all full SHA-256 over a canonical JSON encoding.
- `Task.execute()` / `Task.score()`, so a stored observation can be re-scored
  without re-running the benchmark.
- Atomic result persistence with an emergency dump into the system temp
  directory when the results directory cannot be written.
- `csbench migrate-results SOURCE --output DEST [--dry-run]` and
  `csbench run --debug`.
- A minimal `ResultPublisher` boundary with append-only publish receipts. Core
  ships no publisher.
- Run plans: `csbench run --repeat N --warmup W` executes the benchmark
  `warmup + repeat` times (each still its own auditable `0.2` record), discards
  the warmups, and writes a `run_plan_aggregate` under `results/aggregates/`.
- Statistical aggregation over repeats (`core/statistics.py`): numeric
  measurements get `n`, `mean`, `stdev`, `min`, `max`, `p50`, `p95` and `cv`;
  label measurements get their distribution, `mode` and `agreement`.
- Comparability-aware reporting: `csbench report` pools only records that share
  a `benchmark` **and** `environment` fingerprint, and flags a cell that mixes
  benchmarks (not comparable) or implementation fingerprints (comparable only
  with the caveat that the code changed).

### Changed (breaking)

- `ResultRecord` moved from schema `1.0` to `0.2`. `ok`, top-level `metrics`,
  top-level `evidence_layer` and `config_hash` are gone; migrate old files with
  `csbench migrate-results`.
- `Task.run()` and `TaskOutput` are removed. Implement `execute()` and
  `score()`.
- `clousight_bench.core.schema.config_hash` and
  `clousight_bench.core.schema.EVIDENCE_LAYERS` are removed; fingerprints and
  `core.observation.EVIDENCE_LAYERS` replace them.
- `csbench run` exit codes: `0` for `completed` and `unsupported`, `1` for
  `failed` and `invalid`, `2` for a user input error. A failed run used to exit
  `2`.
- An enricher failure is now isolated: it records an ENRICH stage error and
  leaves `status` alone instead of aborting the run.

### Compatibility

- Package version is pre-1.0.
- Result schema is now `0.2` (migrate `1.0` files with `csbench migrate-results`);
  the plugin API stays `1.0` until Phase 1D.
